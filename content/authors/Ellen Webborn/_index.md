I am a Senior Research Fellow in Data Science and End Use Energy Demand at the [UCL Energy Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/) working on the [Smart Energy Research Lab (SERL)](https://www.serl.ac.uk) project - developing a longitudinal [smart meter dataset](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8666) (with contextual data) for UK-based researchers.
