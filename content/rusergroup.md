The UCL R user group is a friendly group for R users to meet, hear a talk and discuss R questions. Originally set up in 2019 for staff and postgrad students at the Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources [(BSEER)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/bartlett-school-environment-energy-and-resources), we've recently opened up the group to the wider R community at UCL and beyond. 

We currently meet online every 4 weeks on Thursdays at 1-2pm UK time. The idea is to create a friendly space for R users to come together, listen to a talk (typically 20-40 minutes) and ask questions. We aim to have a variety of talks to benefit beginners and more advanced R users. To join the group email e.webborn@ucl.ac.uk

Some talk materials are in our [Github repository](https://github.com/ellenwebborn/bseeR_user_group). Those that can only be shared with group members will be uploaded where possible to our Microsoft Teams group. Contact me to join the group and get a link to the MS Teams group.


## UCL R User Group end-of-year Meetup

Join us on Wednesday 6th July for an exciting talk from Victoria and Albert Museum's Bhavesh Shah on his work as a data scientist using R. We'll also be hosting a peer-programming session for R users to bring their code for help and feedback. Should be a great opportunity to meet other R users, find out how other people code and improve or get help with your code. Plenty of refreshments for all those who can join us in person. For all the details and to sign up check out https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ucl-r-user-group-end-of-year-meetup-tickets-379017049197
