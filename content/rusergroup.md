The UCL R user group is a friendly group for R users to meet, hear a talk and discuss R questions. Originally set up in 2019 for staff and postgrad students at the Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources [(BSEER)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/bartlett-school-environment-energy-and-resources), in 2020 we expanded to welcome the wider R community at UCL and beyond.

We currently meet online every 4 weeks on Thursdays at 1-2pm UK time online and in person. The idea is to create a friendly space for R users to come together, listen to a talk (typically 20-45 minutes) and ask questions. We aim to have a variety of talks to benefit beginners and more advanced R users. To join the group email [e.webborn\@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:e.webborn@ucl.ac.uk)

Talk recordings are available to group members on our Microsoft Teams group. Contact me to join the group and get a link to the MS Teams group. Occasionally our talk materials are on [Github repository](https://github.com/ellenwebborn/bseeR_user_group).
