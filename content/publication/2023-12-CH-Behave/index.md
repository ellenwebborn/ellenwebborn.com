title: "Settling for colder homes as energy prices rise: evidence from 4200 households in Great Britain"

publication: "_BEHAVE 2023_"

abstract: "2022 saw steep rises in energy prices in Great Britain. With gas space heating responsible
for around half of domestic energy consumption, reducing home thermostat setpoints has the
potential to significantly reduce demand and household energy bills.

The Smart Energy Research Lab (SERL) has been collecting smart meter and contextual data
from around 13,000 GB households since 2018. In early 2023 SERL sent a survey to
participants about their recent energy-saving behaviours along with dwelling and household
information (including income and usual heating thermostat setpoint), receiving over 5,000
responses.

This paper presents a statistical analysis of how self-reported SERL participant temperature
setpoints changed in winter 2022/23 compared with those they had reported previously. We
analyse the variation in temperature settings with household (e.g. size, ages, income) and
building (e.g. floor area, EPC rating) characteristics. We combine smart meter and financial
circumstance data to identify those likely to be in fuel poverty and compare the thermostat
setpoints of this group with the wider sample. We also investigate the characteristics of the
households most likely to have reduced their setpoint.

The results show a significant reduction in reported thermostat setpoints in winter 2022/23
compared to winter 2020/21. The proportion of households reporting a setpoint lower than
18Â°C increased from 6.7% to 15.2%. While there are obvious energy efficiency benefits from
thermostat reduction, the large share of households with temperatures lower than the
recommended minimum highlights a concern for policy makers."
